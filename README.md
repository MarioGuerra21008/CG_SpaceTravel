# Space Travel Project

This is a project made in my Computer Graphics class. The objective was simulate a solar system using a software renderer that we developed during the class.

The camera is set on the spaceship I made in Blender, and when you run the project, you will be able to control it with your keyboard.

## Features

* It has a skybox with stars at the backgorund of the screen.
* The camera follows the renderized spaceship, as I said before.
* The orbits of the included planets are all renderized.
* The camera has 3D effects and motion.

You can watch all these features and the shaders I created in the following video! [Space Travel Project Video](https://youtu.be/PLLvnlFUwww)
